⭐Step 1: Open Wireshark
Double-click the Wireshark icon on your PC.
You’ll see the main screen with a list of network interfaces.

⭐Step 2: Select the Network Interface
Look for Ethernet (or the name of your LAN card) — this is the interface connected to your switch.
Click once on the interface name.
You’ll see live graphs and packet counters moving if there’s network activity.

⭐Step 3: Start Capturing
Click the green shark fin icon 🦈 at the top left (it says Start capturing packets)
Wireshark now starts recording all traffic on that interface.

⭐Step 4: Filter Ping Packets
At the top, there’s a filter bar (where it says Apply a display filter...)
Type:
icmp
Press Enter
Now Wireshark will only show Ping packets (Echo Request/Reply).

⭐Step 5: Stop Capturing
After you’ve done the ping from Command Prompt, click the red square icon ⬛ at the top left to stop capturing.

⭐Step 6: Save Capture
Go to File → Save As
Save the file as .pcap (e.g., LAN_ping.pcap) — this is what you can submit in your practical report.

✅ Now you can see:
Source IP → sender of packet
Destination IP → receiver
TTL → Time To Live
ICMP Type → Request or Reply
