🧩 Step 1: Open Wireshark
Make sure Wireshark is installed on your PC.
Double-click to open it.

🧩 Step 2: Identify Your Network Interface
On the Wireshark home screen, you’ll see a list under “Capture → Interfaces” (or just the main list of available network adapters).
Look for the one that is connected to your LAN (the switch). Usually, it’s labeled as:
Ethernet
Or the name of your network card
You’ll see packets being captured live on interfaces that already have traffic.
💡 Tip: If unsure, check which interface shows activity when you move the mouse or ping another PC.

🧩 Step 3: Start Capturing
Click once on your Ethernet interface to select it.
Click the blue shark fin icon (top-left) → Start Capturing.
Wireshark will start displaying all packets passing through your network interface.

🧩 Step 4: Perform Ping Test
While Wireshark is capturing, open Command Prompt on your PC.
Type:
ping 192.168.11.68
Press Enter.

You will now see ICMP packets (Echo Request and Echo Reply) appear in Wireshark.

🧩 Step 5: Filter Only Ping Packets
In the Filter bar at the top, type:
icmp
Press Enter
Now you’ll see only PING-related packets — this makes it easy to analyze.

🧩 Step 6: Stop Capturing
After a few seconds of pinging, click the red square (Stop) button on the top toolbar.
You can save the capture as .pcap file for your practical report.

✅ Now you can:
View the Source IP, Destination IP, TTL, and ICMP Type (Request/Reply)
Demonstrate the packet flow over your wired LAN for the experiment.
