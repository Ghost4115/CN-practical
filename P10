⭐Step 1: Prepare for Packet Capture
Open Wireshark on your PC.
Select the network interface connected to the internet (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).
Make sure no unnecessary applications are running to reduce extra traffic.

⭐Step 2: Capture TCP Traffic to/from Facebook
Start a new capture on your interface.
Open Facebook and log in.
Stop the capture after logging in.
Filter for TCP packets only (display filter)
tcp && ip.addr == <Facebook_IP>
Replace <Facebook_IP> with the IP address of Facebook (you can find by pinging facebook.com in Command Prompt: ping facebook.com).
Save capture:
File → Save As → tcp_facebook.pcap

⭐Step 3: Capture HTTP Traffic to/from Facebook (Other Websites)
Start a new capture.
Browse Facebook (or another website that uses HTTP).
Stop the capture after logging in/browsing.
Filter for HTTP traffic:
http && ip.addr == <Website_IP>
Replace <Website_IP> with the IP address of the other website.
Save capture:
File → Save As → http_facebook_other.pcap

⭐Step 4: Display Filter for TCP Flags
To count TCP packets with specific flags, use Wireshark display filters:
SYN:
tcp.flags.syn == 1
PSH:
tcp.flags.push == 1
RST:
tcp.flags.reset == 1
Apply each filter separately on the captured TCP file (tcp_facebook.pcap).
Wireshark will show the number of packets matching the filter in the status bar at the bottom.
Fraction calculation:
Fraction = (Number of packets with flag set) / (Total TCP packets) * 100%

⭐Step 5: Count TCP vs HTTP Packets for Facebook / Other Website
Open the HTTP capture file (http_facebook_other.pcap).
Apply TCP filter:
tcp && ip.addr == <Website_IP>
Count number of packets → TCP packets sent/received.
Apply HTTP filter:
http && ip.addr == <Website_IP>
Count number of packets → HTTP packets sent/received.
Compare counts:
Some TCP packets are not HTTP (like ACKs, HTTPS handshake, etc.)
Some TCP packets carry HTTP data → difference shows non-HTTP TCP packets.

⭐Step 6: Save Output Files
Wireshark → File → Export Packet Dissections → As Plain Text
Save as tcp_output.txt or http_output.txt
Include filter expressions and packet counts in your report.
